📘 Contact Management Application
This is a simple Contact Management Web Application built using Flask (Python), SQLite, and Bootstrap. It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete — on contact records.

This project was created as part of a task submission for a Python Developer role at Gokul Infocare. It demonstrates not only my technical implementation skills but also my ability to follow structured requirements and submit professional documentation.
